        <h3>Iâ€™m a fullstack web developer with over a decade of experience in project management.</h3>

          <p>A historian turned developer who has worked with private companies as well as for renowned international government institutions to publish academic content and curate exhibitions, I believe in rich interactive websites that work across all platforms and devices.</p>

          <p>Although I'm familiar with using frameworks, I primarily hand-code using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript and put emphasis on browser support and performance. In my backend role, understanding the client-server paradigm and coding using architectural patterns such as MVC has been my focus.</p>
